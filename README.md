## My First Full-Scale Project
This is my first project of such scale, and I've learned so much throughout the process!

What I've learned:
- Working with **Sockets** for real-time communication
- Deploying and managing applications on **Cloud platforms**
- Gaining a deeper understanding of **React** and its ecosystem
- Realizing I can be a really strong **Full-Stack Developer**

## About the Project
This project is an online coding platform that allows mentors and students to collaborate in real-time. 
It features syntax highlighting, live code synchronization, and a lobby system to choose different coding exercises.
 
## Features
- 🚀 **Real-time collaboration**: Live code updates using WebSockets.
- 🎨 **Syntax highlighting**: Easy-to-read and professional coding environment.
- 👨‍🏫 **Mentor-student roles**: Dynamic role assignment for better collaboration.
- 😄 **Fun learning experience**: Big smiley face when the correct solution is achieved.
